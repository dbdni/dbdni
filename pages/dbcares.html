<h1>DBCares</h1>

 <!-- <h3>Mission statement</h3> -->
 <p>
    The mission of DBCares is to create an inclusive and diverse Database community with zero tolerance for abuse, discrimination, or harassment.  
 </p>
 
 <p>
     If any member of the community experiences or observes unacceptable behaviors that create unsafe and unprofessional environments in our conferences, we invite them to reach out to the DBCares committee for help and support.
 </p>
    

<p>
    DBCares was co-started by the VLDB Endowment and SIGMOD Executives in October 2018. The effort primarily focuses on VLDB and SIGMOD activities, to ensure they are carried out in an inclusive and diverse environment. In the long run, DBCares may expand to serve other DB conferences as well.

 <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
 
 <p>
    DBCares follows the ACM policy against abuse, discriminatory harassment, and sexual harassment. Unacceptable behaviors include the following (quoted from ACM policy).  
 </p>

 
 <ul>
     <li>Abuse: Any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that person’s participation; or (b) causes that person to fear for his/her personal safety. This includes threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, or other types of abuse.‬</li>
     <li>Discriminatory Harassment: Any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, nationality, age, sexual or gender identity, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law in the location where the ACM activity takes place.‬</li>
     <li>Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature.</li>
 </ul>

<p>
      ACM policy advises members of our community who have experienced any abuse or harassment to report to “the event chair, a SIG leader, an onsite ACM staff member, and other event organizers who have been designated to handle such complaints at this activity”. The purpose of DBCares is to provide advice from respected and approachable people in the community, such that the reporting is easier and less intimidating.
</p>

<p>The DBCares committee commits to the following responsibilities:</p>
 
<ul>
    <li>Maintain confidentiality for those who reach out for advice and support.</li>
    <li>Listen to reports of unacceptable behavior at VLDB- and SIGMOD-related activities, and provide advice to those targeted towards filing formal complaints if they wish to do so.</li>
    
    <li>Advise the VLDB and/or SIGMOD executives for next steps, if a complaint has been registered with the VLDB/SIGMOD executives.</li>
    <li>Provide to SIGMOD/VLDB executives a summary report of our activities based on the committee members’  experiences in working with the community, ensuring anonymization for those involved in reported incidents.</li>
    <li>Educate all members of our community to take actions against abuse, discrimination, or harassment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
   Note: While DBCares focuses on VLDB and SIGMOD activities, it will listen to cases that may arise in other DB conferences. 
</p>
 
<p>
   Please note that DBCares focuses on supporting and advising members of our community in dealing with unacceptable conduct, and working in conjunction with the SIGMOD and VLDB executives to foster safe conference experiences for our community members.  DBCares will not file official complaints on behalf of members and will not enforce consequences against individuals.  Any potential consequences of unacceptable behavior will be decided and executed by the SIGMOD and VLDB executives.
</p>
 



    
    
<p id="scenarios">&nbsp;</p>
 <h3>Addressing issues: What if an unacceptable behavior happens?</h3>
 

 <p><strong>Scenario 1. </strong>
     When an unacceptable behavior happens, a target can report to event chairs, VLDB/SIGMOD executives, onsite ACM staff members at SIGMOD, and other event organizers who have been designated to handle such complaints. 
 </p>
 
<p> DBCares will provide insights to SIGMOD/VLDB executives on appropriate actions to execute. DBCares will use the ACM policy, previous cases, legal resources for ACM and VLDB Endowment and sister communities for clarifications and suggestions.
</p>

<p> SIGMOD and VLDB executives will make the final decision on the consequences of unacceptable behaviors and take actions accordingly.</p>

<p>
<strong> Scenario 2.</strong> 
When an unacceptable behavior happens, a target can also report to any DBCares committee member, in person or by email. The DBCares committee member who receives such a report has responsibility to understand the case and report to the DBCares committee. The committee will meet to discuss the case and the best action in a confidential manner.
</p>

<p> Then the committee will help a target understand the process and possible consequences in a confidential manner. If with full information, a target decides to report, then DBCares will support the member in filing an official complaint, and follow up with SIGMOD/VLDB executives on appropriate actions to execute as in Scenario 1.
</p>

<p> <strong>Scenario 3.</strong> 
    When a witness becomes aware of an unacceptable behavior directed at another member of the community, they can report to any DBCares committee member, in person or by email. The DBCares committee member who receives such a report has responsibility to report to the DBCares committee. The committee will then contact any target of the unacceptable behavior to understand the case in a confidential manner. When appropriate, the committee will meet to discuss the case and the best action, give advice to the targets as in Scenario 2.
 </p>
 
 <p id="contact">&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Contact for help and reporting</h3>

<p>
    We invite members to communicate with DBCares about any incidents or issues, which they experienced or observed, that may constitute unacceptable behaviors and create unsafe and unprofessional environments.  You may submit concerns or other feedback through the following Google Form:
    
    <p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe18-oiKNzg4m5MfZFjoVr_oNlW3F2cXCu1b-_oRkYUp_xl4Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">Contact DBCares</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The form allows anonymous submissions.  However, we do encourage members to submit their concerns and feedback eponymously, if possible, to ensure that issues can be effectively addressed, and we can support the affected members as well as possible.
        </p>

<p><strong>All submissions are confidential</strong>, and their details will only be shared and discussed within the DBCares committee.  Depending on the issue, and in consultation with the targeted members, we may share information with the SIGMOD and VLDB executives.
</p>
<p>
You are also welcome to reach out to any of the DBCares committee members directly through email, if preferred.
